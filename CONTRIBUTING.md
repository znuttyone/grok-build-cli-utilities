# Contributing to grok-build-cli-utilities

Thank you for your interest in improving grok-build-cli-utilities!

This is a maintainer-driven project focused on high-quality, safe CLI tools for Grok Build users. Contributions that follow the guidelines below are very welcome (bug reports, feature ideas, docs improvements, and well-tested code changes).

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. This is a small, focused tool for the Grok Build community.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cobusgreyling/grok-build-cli-utilities.git
cd grok-build-cli-utilities
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quality Bar (required before any PR)

CI fails on `ruff format --check` **before** pytest. Passing tests alone is not enough.

```bash
make ci
```

That is the local equivalent of the GitHub Actions `test` job:

1. ruff version pin (`>=0.15.0,<0.16` from `pyproject.toml` `dev` extra)
2. `ruff check .`
3. `ruff format --check .`
4. mypy
5. pytest with coverage

If format-check fails, run `make format` and then `make ci` again. Do **not** format with ruff 0.16+; CI installs the pin above and will disagree.

If you touch `docs/`, also run `make docs-build`.

See the Makefile for the full list of convenient targets. The GitHub Actions CI runs these checks on every push and PR (Python 3.10–3.12).

## Testing

- All new code must be accompanied by tests.
- Use `tmp_path` (pytest) + `--grok-home` overrides or monkeypatching for filesystem-dependent commands.
- Prefer testing the happy path + the security/error paths (e.g. bad tar members, invalid skills, prune dry-run).
- Run `make ci` locally before pushing.

## Commit Style

- Use conventional-ish messages: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`.
- Keep commits focused and atomic.
- The project aims for a clean, linear history on `main`.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork + branch from `main`.
2. Make your change + tests + update docs/CHANGELOG if user-facing.
3. Ensure all quality commands above are green.
4. Open a PR with a clear description (what, why, how to test).
5. Be patient — as a solo-maintained project, reviews may take time.

Even if you don't send a full PR, high-quality issues and ideas are greatly appreciated.

## Reporting Issues

Please include:
- `grok-utils --version`
- OS + Python version
- Exact command that failed + full traceback
- (If possible) a minimal reproduction using `--grok-home /tmp/fake`

## Philosophy Reminder

- Safe by default (dry-run for anything destructive).
- Beautiful, fast, scriptable output.
- Works against real user `~/.grok` data — no heavy mocks in production code.
- Minimal dependencies.

## Releasing (maintainers)

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` (move to a new dated section when cutting).
2. Bump version in:
   - `pyproject.toml`
   - `src/grok_build_cli_utilities/__init__.py`
3. `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"` (follow semver).
4. `git push origin main --tags`
5. The `release.yml` workflow will build and publish to PyPI via trusted publishing (configure OIDC on PyPI project settings for this repo + "publish" environment recommended).
6. After publish, verify `pip install grok-build-cli-utilities==X.Y.Z` and update any docs/badges.

Test first with TestPyPI by temporarily editing the release workflow `repository-url`.

Thanks for helping make Grok Build even more productive!
